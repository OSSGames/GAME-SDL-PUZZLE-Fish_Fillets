Fish Fillets NG - 1.0.1
* Fixed a bug in the last levels. Fish were unable to swim to some places.
  It happened next to the room border. The bug was introduced in version 0.9.2.
  Big thanks Radek and Mirek Olsak for discovering it.

Fish Fillets NG - 1.0.0
* Dutch spoken dialogs (by Astrid de Wijn and friends).
* Disallowed a move, to be consistent with the original Fish Fillets.
  Pushing of partially supported objects is disallowed.
  The object has to be supported by a wall or by a fish
  who isn't directly under it.

  You could switch back to the less restrictive rules
  by using "strict_rules=0" config option.
  Thanks Brian Raiter for reporting the discrepancy.
* Provided music looping without fading (by Brian Raiter).
